interrupts change destination and direction

register handling:
r0-r3 - local, no need to preserve
r4  - step counter for train location (current train location, in steps)
r5  - train station destination (in steps)
r6  - train direction (1 for forward, 0 for backward)
r7  - delay register for stepper motors (0x600 for short, 0xFFFF for long)
r8  - step counter for doors
r9  - doors open/close destination (0x1800)
r10 - 
r11 - LED light for System error implementation 
7 Segment delay will show the upcoming delay

// TODO: moveTrain() - function to move train

// TODO: doors() - function to wait, open and close the doors when at a station

// TODO: go to station A inturrupt
    - set destination to A

// TODO: go to station B inturrupt
    - set destination to B

// TODO: go to station C inturrupt
    - set destination to C

// TODO: emergency push button interrupt: stop all movement and blink red LED for 10s 
    - stop Train motion i.e Massive delay;
    - blink red LED
