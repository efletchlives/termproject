Train Location Memory:
    steps per rotation *should* be 4096
    A = 0 rotations, B = 3 rotations * steps per rotation, C = 6 rotations * steps per rotation

Train Direction / Last Station Memory:
    Last Station, LST: A = 0, B = 1, C = 2
    Direction, DIR: forward = 0, backward = 1
    Reserved, RES: unused

    |  DIR   |  RES  |  RES  |  LST   |  LST  |
    |   4    |   3   |   2   |   1    |   0   |


Whenever moving train CW, increment step counter
Whenever moving train CCW, decrement step counter
